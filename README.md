# Generative AI Prompts for Teaching Software Engineering

This repository contains examples of prompts that can be used with generative AI models like [Claude](https://console.anthropic.com/), [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [Google's Bard](https://ai.google/research/bard/) in the context of teaching software engineering topics.

The goal of this repository is to provide educators with a set of prompts tailored for software engineering education that they can use to engage students and enhance their learning experiences. The prompts cover various knowledge areas and topics defined in the [Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK)](https://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/software-engineering/v3).

This is a collaborative project - we welcome contributions from educators adding new prompts, providing feedback on existing ones, and helping to curate and organize this repository. 

To contribute, you can:

- Open a pull request adding new prompts 
- Open an issue suggesting prompts or providing feedback
- Help review and merge pull requests 
- Assist with curating and reorganizing the prompts 

Please check the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on how to contribute.

The prompts in this repository are provided as inspiration and examples. Educators are encouraged to adapt them as needed to suit their particular learning objectives, student levels, and tool preferences.

We hope this repository will be a useful resource for anyone interested in leveraging generative AI to enhance education in software engineering and related fields. Please feel free to use and build upon these materials - and let us know if you have any other questions or suggestions!
